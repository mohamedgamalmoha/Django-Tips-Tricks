Image Display
=============

**Title**: Displaying Images in Django Admin with `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin`

**Description**:
The `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin` enhances the Django admin interface by adding functionality to display image fields
directly in the admin view. This mixin automatically adds an `image_display` field to the admin form's fieldsets and
readonly fields if an image field is present, allowing administrators to see image previews without making them
editable.

Context
-------
Files Affected:
- `mixins.py` (or the specific file where `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin` is implemented)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/admin/p5_image_display/mixins.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-80

Reproduction Steps
------------------
How to Reproduce:
1. Implement a Django admin class that inherits from both `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin` and a standard Django admin class (e.g., `admin.ModelAdmin`).
2. Ensure the model has an `ImageField` field (e.g., `image`).
3. Register the model with the admin class that uses the mixin.
4. Access the Django admin form view for the model.
5. Observe that the image field is displayed as a preview in the admin form.

Expected vs. Actual Behavior:
- **Expected**: Images in the admin form should be displayed as a preview with a specific styling, making it easier to manage image fields visually.
- **Actual**: The image field is correctly displayed as a preview in the admin form, providing a more intuitive interface for administrators.

Cause
-----
Root Cause:
In the standard Django admin, image fields are displayed as file input fields without any visual preview. This makes it difficult to manage images, as administrators cannot easily see the current image associated with a record.

Solution
--------
Fix Summary:
The `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin` was introduced to enhance the admin interface by adding an image preview for models with image fields. This mixin modifies the fieldsets and readonly fields in the admin form to include the `image_display` field, which renders the image using an HTML template.

Code Changes:
This section represents the complete implementation of `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin`, as there was no pre-existing code to "fix." The provided implementation introduces the required functionality from scratch.

Testing
-------
Validation:
- After implementing `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin`, integrate it into an admin class for a model with an `ImageField`.
- Access the Django admin form view for the model and confirm that the image is displayed as a preview with the specified styling.
- Test with different image sizes and formats to ensure that the preview is displayed correctly and does not break the layout.

Conclusion
----------
Summary:
The `ImageFieldDisplayAdminMixin` was implemented to improve the display of image fields in the Django admin by adding a preview of the image. This enhancement makes the admin interface more user-friendly and visually intuitive, especially when managing models with image content.

Best Practices:
- When enhancing the admin interface, focus on making it more intuitive and user-friendly for administrators. Displaying previews of media files is one way to achieve this.
- Ensure that the styling of the image preview is customizable and does not interfere with the overall layout of the admin form.
- Test the mixin across different scenarios to ensure it handles various use cases (e.g., no image, large images, etc.).
