Queryset At Model Admin
=======================

**Title**: Customizing Querysets in Django Admin with `QuerysetAdminMixin`

**Description**:
The `QuerysetAdminMixin` provides a mechanism to customize the queryset used in Django admin views. This mixin allows
developers to specify a custom queryset or default to using the model's default manager's queryset. It enhances
flexibility by enabling different querysets for various admin views without altering the model's manager or creating
unnecessary custom admin classes.

Context
-------
Files Affected:
- `mixins.py` (or the specific file where `QuerysetAdminMixin` is implemented)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/admin/p4_model_admin_queryset/mixins.py
   :language: python

Reproduction Steps
------------------
How to Reproduce:
1. Implement a Django admin class that inherits from both `QuerysetAdminMixin` and a standard Django admin class (e.g., `admin.ModelAdmin`).
2. Optionally define a custom `queryset` attribute in the admin class.
3. Register the model with the admin class that uses the mixin.
4. Access the Django admin list view for the model.
5. Observe the queryset being used in the admin list, either the custom queryset or the default one with applied ordering.

Expected vs. Actual Behavior:
- **Expected**: The Django admin view should use the specified custom queryset if provided, or default to the model's default manager's queryset, with the appropriate ordering applied.
- **Actual**: The admin view correctly displays the queryset as expected, either custom or default, with the intended ordering.

Cause
-----
Root Cause:
By default, Django admin uses the model's default manager's queryset for displaying records. There are cases where a different subset of data or a custom queryset might be needed for specific admin views. Without this mixin, developers would need to override the `get_queryset` method manually in each admin class where a different queryset is required.

Solution
--------
Fix Summary:
The `QuerysetAdminMixin` was introduced to allow Django admin classes to easily specify or customize the queryset used for the admin views. The mixin provides a default implementation of the `get_queryset` method that either uses a custom queryset (if provided) or falls back to the model's default queryset, applying any specified ordering.

Code Changes:
This section represents the complete implementation of `QuerysetAdminMixin`, as there was no pre-existing code to "fix." The provided implementation introduces the required functionality from scratch.

Testing
-------
Validation:
- After implementing `QuerysetAdminMixin`, integrate it into an admin class for a model.
- Define a custom queryset in the admin class and access the admin list view for the model to verify that the custom queryset is used.
- Test with and without specifying the custom queryset to ensure that the mixin correctly defaults to the model's default queryset.

Conclusion
----------
Summary:
The `QuerysetAdminMixin` was implemented to provide an easy and reusable way to customize querysets in Django admin views. This mixin enhances flexibility by allowing the specification of custom querysets or defaulting to the model's manager queryset, making it easier to manage different data subsets within the admin interface.

Best Practices:
- Use mixins like `QuerysetAdminMixin` to centralize logic and reduce code duplication across multiple admin classes.
- Test the mixin thoroughly in different scenarios, such as with and without custom querysets, to ensure consistent behavior.
- Consider the implications of custom querysets on the admin interface, particularly with regard to filtering, searching, and ordering.
