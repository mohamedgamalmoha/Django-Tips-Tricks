**Title**: Adding Icon Links to URL Fields in Django Admin

**Description**:
The `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` is a mixin designed to enhance the Django admin interface by converting URL fields
into clickable icon links. This mixin provides methods to automatically replace URL fields in the Django admin list
display with icons, making it easier to recognize and interact with URL fields directly from the list view.

Context
-------
Files Affected:
- `mixins.py` (or the specific file where `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` is implemented)

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/admin/p6_icon_link/mixins.py
   :language: python

Reproduction Steps
------------------
How to Reproduce:
1. Implement a Django admin class that inherits from both `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` and a standard Django admin class (e.g., `admin.ModelAdmin`).
2. Ensure the model has one or more `URLField` fields.
3. Register the model with the admin class that uses the mixin.
4. Access the Django admin list view for the model.
5. Observe that URL fields are displayed as clickable icons instead of plain text links.

Expected vs. Actual Behavior:
- **Expected**: URL fields in the Django admin list view should be displayed as clickable icons, corresponding to the field name or a mapped icon name.
- **Actual**: The URL fields are displayed as clickable icons as expected, improving the visual clarity and usability of the admin interface.

Cause
-----
Root Cause:
In the standard Django admin, URL fields are displayed as plain text links. This can be visually unappealing and harder to recognize, especially when multiple URL fields are present. There was a need for a more visually engaging way to display these fields.

Solution
--------
Fix Summary:
The `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` was introduced to enhance the display of URL fields in the Django admin by converting them into clickable icon links. This mixin handles the creation of custom display functions for URL fields and integrates them seamlessly into the admin list display.

Code Changes:
This section represents the complete implementation of `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin`, as there was no pre-existing code to "fix." The provided implementation introduces the required functionality from scratch.

Testing
-------
Validation:
- After implementing `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin`, integrate it into an admin class for a model with URL fields.
- Access the Django admin list view for the model and confirm that URL fields are displayed with the appropriate icons.
- Test with different field names and icon mappings to ensure that the mixin correctly associates icons with URL fields.

Conclusion
----------
Summary:
The `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` was implemented to improve the display of URL fields in the Django admin by replacing plain text links with clickable icons. This enhancement makes the admin interface more user-friendly and visually appealing.

Best Practices:
- Utilize mixins like `URLFieldShowLinkAdminMixin` to centralize and reuse logic across multiple admin classes, reducing code duplication.
- Test admin interface enhancements in different scenarios to ensure they work as intended and improve the overall user experience.
- Consider the customization options, such as icon mapping, to provide flexibility in how fields are displayed in the admin.
