Extra Context
=============


**Title**: Enhancement of Admin Views with Additional Context

**Description**:
The `AdminContextMixin` is designed to enhance the Django admin views by allowing additional context to be passed to
the templates. This mixin provides a unified way to include extra context across various admin views, ensuring that
custom data can be easily incorporated into the admin interface.

Context
-------
Files Affected:
- `mixins.py` (or the specific file where `AdminContextMixin` is implemented)

.. literalinclude::  ../../../src/admin/p7_extra_context/mixins.py
   :language: python

Reproduction Steps
------------------
How to Reproduce:
1. Create a Django admin class that inherits from both `AdminContextMixin` and a standard Django admin class (e.g., `admin.ModelAdmin`).
2. Define the `extra_context` attribute or pass `extra_context` in any of the admin view methods (`changelist_view`, `add_view`, etc.).
3. Access the corresponding admin views for any model using this admin class.
4. Observe that the custom context is correctly merged and rendered in the admin interface.

Expected vs. Actual Behavior:
- **Expected**: The admin views should render with both the standard context provided by Django and any additional context defined in `extra_context`.
- **Actual**: The views will include the additional context as expected, enhancing the flexibility of the admin interface.

Cause
-----
Root Cause:
There was a need to simplify the process of adding custom context to Django admin views. The absence of a mixin to handle this task across multiple views led to repetitive and error-prone code in various admin classes.

Solution
--------
Fix Summary:
The `AdminContextMixin` was introduced to provide a consistent and reusable way to include additional context in Django admin views. This mixin centralizes the logic for merging extra context with the standard context, streamlining the process for developers.

Code Changes:
This section represents the complete implementation of `AdminContextMixin`, as there was no pre-existing code to "fix." The provided implementation introduces the required functionality from scratch.

Testing
-------
Validation:
- After implementing `AdminContextMixin`, integrate it into an admin class.
- Access different admin views (changelist, add, change, delete, history) for models using the mixin.
- Verify that the custom context is correctly included in the rendered views.
- Ensure that there are no issues with the base functionality of the admin views.

Conclusion
----------
Summary:
The `AdminContextMixin` was implemented to simplify the inclusion of additional context in Django admin views. This mixin allows developers to define and pass extra context easily, improving the flexibility and maintainability of admin customizations.

Best Practices:
- When designing reusable components like mixins, ensure that they provide a clear and consistent interface for common tasks.
- Centralizing logic that would otherwise be duplicated across multiple classes not only reduces code repetition but also minimizes the risk of errors.
- Thoroughly test mixins and similar utilities across all intended use cases to ensure they function correctly in different contexts.
